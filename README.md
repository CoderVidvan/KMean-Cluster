# K-Means Clustering Implementation

This repository contains a basic implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. The notebook demonstrates how K-Means works through visualizations and custom logic, without relying on scikit-learn.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- Manual implementation of the K-Means algorithm.
- Step-by-step clustering on 2D data.
- Visualization of clusters and centroids.
- Comparison with scikit-learn’s built-in KMeans (if included).

## 📁 Files

- `K_means_Implementation.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the clustering algorithm and visual results.

## 🔧 Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
